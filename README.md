# baseball_MVP_prediction

This is a machine learning ensemble model to predict the MVP from season statistics. I held out 30% of the years from 1911 to 2015 as testing data and trained the models on the remaining data. My top prediciton is 54% accurate in any given year. The top six predicitons for any year have an 89% likelihood of containing the MVP winner for that year. The AUC of the ROC curve is 0.989.
